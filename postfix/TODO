Add a note to tlsproxy source why it does not enforce deadlines or
minimum data rates. Reason: tlsproxy relies on the plaintext client
to enforce their context-dependent deadlines and data rates. When
a plaintext client times out, it will close the tlsproxy connection,
and then tlsproxy will also hang up.
