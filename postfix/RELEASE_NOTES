This is the Postfix 3.7 (experimental) release.

The stable Postfix release is called postfix-3.6.x where 3=major
release number, 6=minor release number, x=patchlevel.  The stable
release never changes except for patches that address bugs or
emergencies. Patches change the patchlevel and the release date.

New features are developed in snapshot releases. These are called
postfix-3.7-yyyymmdd where yyyymmdd is the release date (yyyy=year,
mm=month, dd=day).  Patches are never issued for snapshot releases;
instead, a new snapshot is released.

The mail_release_date configuration parameter (format: yyyymmdd)
specifies the release date of a stable release or snapshot release.

If you upgrade from Postfix 3.5 or earlier, read RELEASE_NOTES-3.6
before proceeding.

Major changes with snapshot 20210814-nonprod
============================================

Updated defense against remote clients or servers that 'trickle'
SMTP or LMTP traffc. The new {smtpd,smtp,lmtp}_per_request_deadline
parameters replace {smtpd,smtp,lmtp}_per_record_deadline, with
backwards compatible default settings.

The new smtpd_per_record_deadline parameter limits the combined
time for the Postfix SMTP server to receive a request and to send
a response, while the new {smtp,lmtp}_per_record_deadline parameters
limit the combined time for the Postfix SMTP or LMTP client to send
a request and to receive a response.

Additionally, the new smtpd_min_data_rate parameter enforces a
minimum data transfer rate for DATA and BDAT commands. After N
plaintext bytes are transferred, the deadline is decreased by the
elapsed time of the plaintext or TLS read request, and then increased
by N/smtpd_min_data_rate. However the deadline is never increased
beyond the smtpd_timeout value. The {smtp,lmtp}_min_data_rate
parameters enforce the corresponding minimum DATA transfer rates
for the Postfix SMTP and LMTP client. The default minimum data rate
is 500 (bytes/second) but is still subject to change.

Major changes with snapshot 20210605
====================================

Support to inline the content of small cidr, pcre, and regexp tables.

Example:

    smtpd_forbidden_commands =
	CONNECT GET POST regexp:{{/^[^A-Z]/ Thrash}}

The basic syntax is:

/etc/postfix/main.cf:
    parameter = .. map-type:{ { rule-1 }, { rule-2 } .. } ..

/etc/postfix/master.cf:
    .. -o { parameter = .. map-type:{ { rule-1 }, { rule-2 } .. } .. } ..

Postfix ignores whitespace after '{' and before '}', and writes each
rule as one text line to an in-memory file: 

in-memory file:
    rule-1
    rule-2
    ..

Postfix parses the result as if it is a file in /etc/postfix.

Note: if a rule contains $, specify $$, to keep Postfix from trying to
do $name expansion as it evaluates the parameter value.
